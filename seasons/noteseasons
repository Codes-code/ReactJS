COMPONENTS------
Components are function or Class that render html using jsx, and handle user feedback
Functional Components to be used for simple content, and Class Components to be used for everything else. 

Benifits of Class Components over Functional Components- 
1. Easier code organising (helper funcitons can be cumbersome in function based components)
2. Can use 'state' system. easier to handle user input and update how our app looks based on input. 
3.  Lifecycle- easier to do things when our app first starts

//To understand the differences between Class Components and Functional Components

but if northern and between march and october OR south and between october and march THEN hit the BEACH
//TASKS-
//get physical location
//get current month
//change styling and text based on those parameters
