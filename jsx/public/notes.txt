Public-static files. that we don't change, like images, or html file. etc. 
src- where we edit and add remove, write code/files. we might delete the default files created by create-react-app in this folder and create our own files. 
package.json- all the dependancies
packaage_lock.json- versions of all the dependancies

Every file is a universe in itself, so we will import whatever we need to reference or use, for eg. libraries like 'react' or other files. 

Babel turns versions of javascript into the ones compatible with most browsers. It also turns jsx into normal js. babeljs.io can show me that. 

differences between jsx and html- 
1. style={{backgroundColor:'red'}}
2. Class=classname to avoid contradiction with the JS class.
